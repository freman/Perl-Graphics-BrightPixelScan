Bright Pixel Scan
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background:
	I noticed some excessively bright pixels after taking a couple of longer exposure
photos with my Canon 1000D DSLR camera.

Concerned this might be a symptom larger defect but unable to devote hours to manual
scanning of pixels I wrote this simple script to check each pixel one by one for a value
greater than a given threshold.

How to use it:
	Put your lens cap on
	Switch your camera to TV
	Spin the dial to 10 seconds
	Turn off all the lights (prevents viewfinder interference)
	Press the shutter button
	Take the resulting image and feed it to this script

Run the script without any arguments for a synopsis and arguments
